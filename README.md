### git pull basics 

`git branch <branch_name>` create new branch

`git branch` list all of the branches in your repo. Same as `git branch --list`

`git branch -a` list all remote branches.

`git branch -d <branch_name>` delete the specified branch . `SAFE` because git prevents you from removing the unmerged branch

`git branch -D <branch_name>` FORCE delete the specified branch. `UNSAFE`, branch will be removed even if it has unmerged changes.

`git branch -m <new_branch_name>` Rename the current branch to <new_branch_name>
